01 Drawing: My emoji reveals complexity by showing a grey emoji surrounded by coloured symbols around their head. I chose these colours as it represents how the individual has been drained by their complex (colourful) thoughts and trying to make sense of them. I have exaggerated this further by writing a hidden message in the form of binary code so the viewer themselves experiences the same complex feeling by helping the individual make sense of their thoughts and figure out what the binary says. I also incorporated eyes pointing in separate directions to represent how the emoji is muddled and confused.

02 Movement: This represents the muddled up thoughtd I experience throughout my everyday life. They happen when I interact with people or present ideas. A way in which this is represented is how the words first appesr on the screen and don't disappear. I decided to iclude the interactive circles in order to convey the idea of how interaction adds more chaos to my mind.I origionally wanted the circle to grow in the centre of the cirle but faced some challenges with the code. This also happened where I wanted the circle to not leave a trail but was unable to get it to work without causing the text to disappear, I understand why this happened as when I put the background in the draw tab it would loop with the rest of the text continously covering the text and mouse interaction.
